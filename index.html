        <p>  Let the paint work. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play. Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us. It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy. But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it.</p>

    <header><h2>Dinosaurs!</h2></header>
      <section>
        <p>A snake slithers across a tree branch, past what looks like the large iris of a flower. The flower blinks. It's the eye of the raptor. Muldoon sees it. He raises his gun. Instead of running away again, the raptor rises slowly out of the brush, fully revealing itself to Muldoon, hissing at him. The corners of Muldoon's mouth twitch up into a smile. He draws a bead on the animal. His finger tenses on the trigger. Suddenly, his smile vanishes, both eyes pop open, and a terrible thought sweeps across his face. His eyes flick to the side "Clever girl"</p>

      <p> "John, the kind of control you're attempting is not possible. If there's one thing the history of evolution has taught us, it's that life will not be contained. Life breaks free. It expands to new territories. It crashes through barriers. Painfully, maybe even dangerously, but and...well, there it is." Ellie listens to him, impressed. Watch her head - support her head. Grant, ignoring the others, picks up the baby dinosaur, and holds it on the palm of his hand, under the incubator's heat light. He spreads the tiny animal out on the back of his hand and delicately runs his finger over its tail, counting the vertebrae. A look of puzzled recognition crosses his face. "You're implying that a group of composed entirely of females will breed?" "I'm simply saying that life - - finds a way.</p>

Meowwww play riveting piece on synthesizer keyboard and kitty loves pigs and wake up human for food at 4am or hack up furballs favor packaging over toy for sleep in the bathroom sink.

        <p> Bunnies aren't just cute like everybody supposes. And zombies don't eat brains anyway, unless instructed to by their zombie master. Uh, thermal exhaust port's above the main port, numbnuts. These are stone killers, little man. They ain't cuddly like me. Yes, I'd forgotten you're moonlighting as a criminal mastermind now. I'll kill a man in a fair fight. Or if I think he's gonna start a fair fight. Or if he bothers me. Or if there's a woman. Or if I'm getting paid. Mostly when I'm getting paid. Now you can luxuriate in a nice jail cell, but if your hand touches metal, I swear by my pretty floral bonnet: I will end you. See, morbid and creepifying, I got no problem with, long as she does it quiet-like. Recognizing someone else's power does not diminish your own. </p>
        
        <p> Some terrifying space monkeys maybe got loose? She alone will stand against the vampires the demons and the forces of darkness. Can everybody just notice how much fire I'm not on? I knew you were lying. Undead liar guy. Easy as really difficult pie. If I could make you purtier, I would. They're just a bunch of hormonal time bombs. But I haven't spent any money! I was all... dead and frugal.</p>
